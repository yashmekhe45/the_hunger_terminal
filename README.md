# Why did we build The Hunger Terminal ? What motivated us?

At Josh Software till last year, a single caterer was present. Most of the times, not all the employees used to like food which resulted in food wastage. So, this platform was created from where employees can easily order their food from registered vendors. Our main motive was to reduce food and water wastage.
